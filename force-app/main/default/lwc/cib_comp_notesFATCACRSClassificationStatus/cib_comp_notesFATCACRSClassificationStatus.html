          The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a new US tax law
          designed to prevent US taxpayers from avoiding tax by channelling US
          source income through non-US foreign financial institutions (FFIs) and
          off-shore investment vehicles so as to conceal their assets from the
          US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The objective of FATCA is for the
          US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to detect offshore tax evasion by US
          citizens or residents by requesting information about U.S. persons and
          imposing a withholding tax where the applicable documentation and
          reporting requirements are not met.
